# Krazy Kitchen

Krazy Kitchen is a thrilling online cooperative game that challenges you and your friends to complete various recipes amidst chaotic situations. Inspired by the popular Overcooked game series, this is our unique take on the concept. With limited space and time, players must skillfully navigate through a multitude of tasks and ingredients to successfully prepare dishes. From gathering and cutting ingredients to cooking and combining them, the gameplay revolves around the exciting process of creating and delivering food. However, the real enjoyment stems from the pandemonium that ensues when tackling levels individually, as players soon realize that true success can only be achieved through teamwork and collaboration.
