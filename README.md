# Krazy Kitchen

Krazy Kitchen is an online cooperative game where a group of your friends attempt to complete several recipes under chaotic situations. This is our own implementation of the Overcooked game series. Space and time is limited and completing recipes are a combination of many different tasks and ingredients. This game requires users to get, cut, cook, combine and then deliver food. The true fun comes from the pandemonium that accompanies attempting levels individually and discovering through gameplay that the only way to succeed is to work together.
